###SOA Microservice API

#### Microservices architecture is an alternative approach to structuring applications. An application is broken into smaller, completely independent components, enabling them to have greater agility, scalability, and availability. SOA exposes the functions of applications as more readily accessible service interfaces, making it easier to use their data and logic in the next generation of applications.
